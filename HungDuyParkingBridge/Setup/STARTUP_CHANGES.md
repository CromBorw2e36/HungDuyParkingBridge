# Startup Method Changes for Hung Duy Parking Bridge

## Changes Implemented

1. **Removed Startup Folder Shortcut Method**
   - Eliminated the {commonstartup} shortcut entry from the [Icons] section
   - The application now uses only the Registry method for startup
   - Added additional cleanup for any existing startup shortcuts from previous installations

2. **Enhanced Registry-Based Startup**
   - Kept the Registry startup entry in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
   - Updated the description in [Tasks] section to clarify it's registry-based
   - Ensured proper cleanup of all old registry entries (both HKCU and HKLM)
   - Added uninsdeletevalue flag to ensure registry entry is removed during uninstall

3. **Added Startup Shortcut Cleanup**
   - Created new RemoveStartupShortcuts procedure to clean up any existing shortcuts
   - Called this procedure during both setup and uninstall to ensure thorough cleanup
   - This handles migration from the old approach (shortcuts) to the new approach (registry only)

4. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated README_MANUAL_INSTALLER.txt with information about startup method changes
   - Updated README.md with detailed explanation of registry-based startup
   - Added troubleshooting section for startup issues
   - Clarified manual installation instructions to use registry method

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Simplified Startup Management**
   - Single source of truth for startup configuration (registry only)
   - No duplicate startup entries caused by multiple startup methods
   - Cleaner uninstall process that removes all startup traces

2. **Better Administrator Experience**
   - Registry-based startup is more consistent with Windows best practices
   - Makes it easier for administrators to manage via Group Policy
   - Better visibility in system management tools

3. **Improved Reliability**
   - Registry startup entries are more reliable than shortcuts in some cases
   - Less likely to be affected by profile migrations or folder permissions
   - Centralized management through Registry rather than filesystem

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify the installer correctly adds the registry startup entry when that option is selected
2. Verify the installer does NOT create a startup shortcut
3. Test uninstallation to ensure the registry entry is properly removed
4. Test installation on a system that previously had the application installed to ensure old startup entries are cleaned up
